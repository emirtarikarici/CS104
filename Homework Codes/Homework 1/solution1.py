# because i want to use real value of pi, import math library
import math as math

# define pi and radius in a variable, pi and r
pi = math.pi
d = float(input("diameter:" ))

# define the formula of the area of circle in a variable, area 
area = (d / 2) ** 2 * pi

# print the calculation
print(area)
